### 1. The "Infinite Bite" Interaction
This isn't just a static image. You’ve built a logic-based interaction where the burger visually disappears bite-by-bite and then "respawns" once it's finished. Most beginner sites only use static images.
### 2. Particle Physics Crumb System
You used JavaScript to create a "firework" effect of yellow crumbs that fall with gravity. This is a very advanced "extra" that goes beyond simple HTML/Tailwind. It gives the site a "game-like" feel.
### 3. Dynamic "Mood" Progress Bars
Instead of just listing calories, you used Tailwind's w-1/2 and w-[70%] classes inside gray containers to create visual health bars. This turns a boring data point into a cool UI element
### 4. Interactive Logo Animation
Your Hack Club logo isn't just a link; it has a custom hover state: hover:scale-125 hover:rotate-12. This "micro-interaction" makes the header feel professional and polished.
### 5. Multi-Style Menu Cards
You didn't just copy-paste the same card. You designed three distinct "tiers":
### 6. Hand-Coded "Bento-Box" Layout
The way your rules section (the yellow box) is tilted with rotate-1 and has a heavy border-b-8 gives it a "scrapbook" or "zines" aesthetic that is very popular in the Hack Club community. It shows you didn't just use a generic template.
